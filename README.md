## Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 31 Dec 2024

Learn Tracks ("the App") is a MacOS application designed to help users organize and track their learning progress by saving YouTube links and article URLs from the web. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy outlines how we handle data when you use the App.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or other identifiable data. All operations performed by the App occur locally on your device.

2. Data Organization and Progress Tracking

The App allows users to save and organize YouTube links and article URLs for personal use. All data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or third parties. The App does not access or share any of your organized content.

3. Permissions

The App does not require special permissions beyond the ability to save and access data on your device. It does not access any files, folders, or system data unrelated to its functionality.

4. Third-Party Services

The App does not use or integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or analytics tools. All functionality is self-contained and performed on your device.

5. Data Security

Because the App does not transmit or store any data externally, there is no risk of data breaches or unauthorized access. All information you save within the App remains on your device.

6. User Choices

The App allows you to:

Save YouTube links and article URLs.

Organize and track your learning progress.

These actions are entirely controlled by you, and the App does not store or share these preferences or data with anyone.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in a new version of the Privacy Policy, which will be made available alongside the App.
